            <h2>The Dragon Ball Franchise</h2>
                <p>Created in 1984 by Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball is a franchise that has spanned across mediums such as manga, anime, video games, figurines, card games and much more.</p>
                <p>Starting as a manga serialized in Weekly Shonen Jump, the original story contained 519 chapters collected across 42 volumes. The story is loosely inspired by the Chinese story, Journey to the West, and follows the adventures of Son Goku, from his childhood and well into his adult years.</p>
                <p>The original manga would run 11 years and conclude in May of 1995, while being adapted into two anime, Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. However, that would not be the end of the story, we would see a few spin off manga, movies, two anime exclusive sequels and midquel manga that would be adapted into an anime as well.</p>
                <p>In between manga and anime productions, video games, trading cards and collectible merchandise would be produced and fans would continue to seek new content. Always wondering what was next for Goku and his friends.</p>
                <p>As of 2025, the story continues in the Dragon Ball Super manga, initially written by Akira Toriyama and manga artist Toyotarou.</p>
                <p>Tragically, Akira Toriyama would pass away in March of 2024, leaving behind a legacy that has left a super Saiyan sized mark on pop culture.</p>
